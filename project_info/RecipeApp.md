PURPOSE:

The purpose of the recipe app will be to store commonly used family recipes and retrieve them for viewing, ideally on mobile, but the app will be made to look nice on a PC as well. 

LAYOUT:

I want the layout to faciliate finding recipes rapidly and also want it to be very easy to read the recipe ingredients and instructions. 

My vision is a single page app with a search bar. When you type into the searchbar, recipes in the database that contain the typed search-string will appear below the searchbar. When the user clicks a recipe name, the page will change and will only render the recipe title/name, ingredients, and instructions. They layout of the title, ingredients, and instructions will mirror an old church cookbook my family owns, where the ingredients will git in a two column grid and the instructions will simply be a paragraph beneath the ingredients. The basic layout, from top to bottom, will be recipe title, ingredients, and then instructions. At the very bottom, I want buttons to appear that will allow the user to make modifications to the recipe. There will be two buttons at the bottom, one for editing the recipe and another for deleting it. At the top, next to the searchbar, there will be a third button for adding brand new recipes.
